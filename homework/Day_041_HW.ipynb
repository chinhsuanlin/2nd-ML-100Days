    "Advantages:\n",
    "Decision Trees are easy to explain. It results in a set of rules.\n",
    "It follows the same approach as humans generally follow while making decisions.\n",
    "Interpretation of a complex Decision Tree model can be simplified by its visualizations. Even a naive person can understand logic.\n",
    "The Number of hyper-parameters to be tuned is almost null.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "There is a high probability of overfitting in Decision Tree.\n",
    "Generally, it gives low prediction accuracy for a dataset as compared to other machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "Information gain in a decision tree with categorical variables gives a biased response for attributes with greater no. of categories.\n",
    "Calculations can become complex when there are many class labels."
